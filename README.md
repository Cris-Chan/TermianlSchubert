# TerminalSchubert-acuProject

Work in progress

This is a project for my object oriented programming course.
the assignment is to design an adventure game using c++ and object oriented techniques.

---Story---
In this adventure game you are a student at ACU who needs to pass his bible class.
you decide the only way to do it is to hack into president Phil Schuberts computer (where everyones grades are always stored)
and change your grade so you dont have to retake the class.
But in this quest to pass bible you uncover some secrets and learn that Phil Schubert is a RUSSIAN sleepr agent set to activate
during wildcate week and BODY SLAM the school spirit out of willy the wildcat. *Dramatic inception like SFX*
so to beat the game you must find a way to stop phil schubert from ever activating and save ACU school spirit.

---Mechanics---
This game idealy loosely simulates the UNIX terminal on a very basic level along with many fake/goofy and inaccurate commands.
you navigate through the files on Phil Schuberts MacBook to read files that uncover the storyline and edit settings to unlock
new directories and progress the story.
