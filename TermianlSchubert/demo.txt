//NOTE: because this is a different style of a text game there are not really any "rooms", at least non in the traditional adventure game sense.
// we are thinking of adding some towards the end of the game where you actually leave the computer to stop
// Phil Schubert. Though the directories can be interpreted as "rooms"
// ****OTHER NOTE: there are extra classes that was not in the outline, they have no function at the moment, i just put them there so to use in the future.
// was just an idea for better data managment down the road for this project
// OTHER OTHER NOTE: this is a really fun assignment :)

*press enter* (AFTER TEXT APPEARS)
type "hack"
*press enter* (AFTER TEXT APPEARS)
enter any name you want (example: "Prather")
//Now (after broken loading screen) you should be in the root directory of phil Schuberts MacBook
type "help"
type "cd topsecretfiles"
press enter button a few times just to demonstrate that it acts similar to other terminals
type "ls"
type "read russianTransmission.txt"

//This is bassically all we have functioning so far, there is some code for more functions but its not really at its best at the moment so its not accessable
// Other directories that work are: "home", "users", "downloads", and "topsecretfiles"
